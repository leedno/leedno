# Hi, I'm Leon Nordell 👋

**Aspiring Full-Stack Developer | B.Eng. in ICT Student**

I'm a third-year **Information and Communications Technology (ICT) student** at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences, currently pursuing my degree 100% remotely. My primary focus is on mastering modern web development, which I see as a highly creative field driven by my lifelong passion for complex puzzles.
